# ML2
A content-based recommender system that recommends movies similar in content

The movies are recommended based on the content of the movie you entered or selected. The main parameters that are considered for the recommendations are the genre, director, and top 3 casts. The details of the movies, such as title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, casts, etc., are fetched from TMDB.

# Cosine Similarity
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
